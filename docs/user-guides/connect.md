# Connect to Your Wallet

In this section, we will walk you through how to make preparation for Obridge.

Before you start to make your token asset flow,  you need to connect to your wallet and Obridge.

> For Now, Obridge only supports MetaMask wallet.

Firstly, launch the Obridge App on your browser.

https://alpha.obridge.io/

Next, click the CONNECT WALLET button on the right top of the app page.
